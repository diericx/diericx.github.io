My name is Zac Holland and I am an avid programmer from Mountain View, California. I am currently a student at DU studying computer science. This website will showcase each of my active projects. 
Each project has a short description, with maybe a few screenshots. After that you will see the blog
for each project so you can follow the progress. Enjoy!
