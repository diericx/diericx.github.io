When I released Llama or Duck, it didn't do as well as I thouhgt it would. I knew it was a good concept with high potential so I decided to rebrand it. I replaced every picture with puppies and kittens and submitted it. Because of the young Nook audience, it did almost 10x better than Llama or Duck. 
I wish I could show the data but the Nook market has been shit down and I don't have access to the dashboard anymore.
