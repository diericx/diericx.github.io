At the time that I made Llama or Duck, a game was becoming really popular at my school. I can't remember what animals it was using but it was almost the same concept. I decided to make a similar app for the Nook because the market was new and didn't much on it at all. The app was something like $0.99 and made me a little bit of money, but not enough to be significant. I then decided to rebrand it and made Kitten or Puppy in hopes that this would do better on the younger Nook market.
